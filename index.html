          <th>No. of books: 4 (main) [Has 2 side stories] <br>Was quite interesting cause with every book a certain part of the plot solved... so not cliff-hanger vibe</th>

          <th>Throne of Glass</th>
          <th>7.5/10</th>
          <th>No. of books: 7 (main) [Has 1 side stories] <br>Was Interesting but after a while, nearing the end the storyline felt quite draggy to me</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>The Making of Riley Paige</th>
          <th>8/10</th>
          <th>No. of books: 6 <br>The main plot was really interesting... however, the side story is just not as intriguing</th>
